                Adventure Trails has your enjoyment in mind, and this is also
                based on your safety and well-being. While we will always do our
                utmost to ensure an pleasurable trek, it helps if you prepare
                yourself. Read up on the trip you are going to take, look at the
                links we provide, and make sure you come with suitable clothing
                and footwear.

                Scaling a 2,000 meter summit may seem possible from the
                perspective of your living room, but you need to make sure you
                are in good enough shape to do so! While it may be tempting to
                book the most demanding trail for your first hike, it may make
                sense to start with something a little easier. If you have a
                medical condition this also should be taken into account. Some
                trips may require vaccinations, be sure to check on the details
                provided.

                Some cultures may frown on certain forms of dress or behaviour,
                and it is expected that our travellers respect these customs,
                regardless of whether or not one agrees with them. Our
                environmental policy is "leave a place tidier than you found
                it". It is taken as a given that our guests show respect for the
                environment, such that future travellers also may enjoy it.
